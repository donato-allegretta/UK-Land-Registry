# UK Land Registry Paid Price Analysis

I analysed UK Land Registry prices data to develop a dashboard for examining property prices by counties and London boroughs from 2018 to 2022. I conducted data cleaning, performed descriptive analysis, and carried out data wrangling tasks.

The outcome of the project was a user-friendly dashboard that facilitated interactive exploration and analysis of property prices by counties and London boroughs from 2018 to 2022. The dashboard enables users to gain insights into regional price trends and make data-driven decisions in the UK real estate market.
